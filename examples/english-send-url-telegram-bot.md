### Instruction manual

To start, install the extension, create a board and go to the board settings

Then go to telegram and create your own bot through the built-in official bot named [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) and get a special token to control the bot in my case it is ```1933441686:AAGcU7fYq5-CTnmjT75mg_V7_xQ1f681enY```

The next step is to find out the ```id``` of your telegram profile this can be done through the bot [IDBot] (https://t.me/myidbot) the following id is attached to my profile: ```1813232702```

Then you must send a message to your bot so that it can write to you otherwise telegram bots cannot write to the first telegram users.

The next step is to add a link with your data to the extension.

![step5](https://github.com/prohetamine/Copycan/blob/main/media/send-url-telegram-bot-5.png)

My link looks like this: ```https://api.telegram.org/bot1933441686:AAGcU7fYq5-CTnmjT75mg_V7_xQ1f681enY/SendMessage?chat_id=1813232702&text=copycan``` where ```1933441686:AAGcU7fYq5-CTnmjT75mg_V7_xQ1f681enY``` is a token for controlling the bot and ```1813232702``` is the ID of the chat or channel that will receive messages from the extension, in my case this is my user profile, and ```copycan``` is a variable that will be replaced with the message text.
